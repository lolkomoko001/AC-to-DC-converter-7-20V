<h1>Hello</h1> I made Small (5x3,5cm) AC to DC converter for 7 V-20 V . Withou heatsink for tranzistor its usable to around 10 V or 200mA before heating much . I made it at school with acid so its sort of double layer one for components and the other for traces. It took me around 1,5 hours to fully complete it. If you have any recommendations how to make it better type :)


Components are mirrored like i have on my board 
items used:

4x wires

4x 1N4007 diodes

1x LED diode

1x capacitor 100uF

1x capacitor 0,1uF

1x 470ohm resistor

1x tranzistor L7805CP 

and one 5x3,5 cm pcb

Here are some photos of the project
